# donkey2 template from `donkeycar` package

## Summary

This example is a blank (i.e., without a trained "autopilot") controller as from
`donkey2` template, introduced at https://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/get_driving/

Because the simulation evaluation only checks for the existence of some motion
command, this example is sufficient to reach hardware-in-the-loop evaluation.
Eventually, more sophisticated simulation requirements will motivate extending
or replacing this example.
