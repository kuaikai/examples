# trivial, vacuous example

## Summary

The ambition of this example is to show sufficient contents for a file to be
accepted into a simulation job. It contains all shell scripts that are required
by [the interface specification](
https://kuaikai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interface.html). However, they do
nothing, and as such, the simulation job will fail.

## Packaging

Run

    make

to produce the file `trivial.tgz`, which can be submitted.
